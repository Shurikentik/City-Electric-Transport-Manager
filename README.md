The project is designed for 4 types of users of the urban electric transport system: Cashiers, Drivers, Dispatchers and Administrators. Each of them has the following functions:
The cashier can issue a ticket for different periods of time;
A driver can report a malfunction of electric vehicles;
The dispatcher can create and adjust timetables and routes of electric vehicles, and manage the deployment of electric vehicles on the route;
The administrator can view the organization's statistics (profit, average ticket price, etc.), as well as add new users to the system
